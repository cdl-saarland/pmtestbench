# Extracted Resource Mapping of Palmed


The file `palmed_zen_extracted_2021-11-25.json` contains the Zen resource mapping in Palmed's conjunctive model that we extracted from `scw-zen.2021-11-25.mapping` in [Palmed's available source code](https://gitlab.inria.fr/nderumig/palmed/-/tree/master/results/data?ref_type=heads).
It contains a mapping from their instruction identifiers to identifiers of representatives with the same resource usage (`instr_to_class`) and a mapping from these representatives to the resources they use (`class_to_resources`).

The file `fixed_palmed_insn_map.json` contains a mapping of our instruction scheme identifiers to matching Palmed instruction identifiers. This mapping was created in a partly manual and partly automated process.

This mapping has been used in the evaluation of our paper "Explainable Port Mapping Inference with Sparse Performance Counters for AMDâ€™s Zen Architectures".

The original data has been produced by Derumigny et al. for the paper "PALMED: throughput characterization for superscalar architectures" (2022).
